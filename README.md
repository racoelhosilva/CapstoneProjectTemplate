# Capstone Project Template

This template was developed by me (Rodrigo) for the Capstone Project of the Bachelor's in Informatics and Computing Engineering (L.EIC) at FEUP.

The goal is to maintain the original end document structure but give it a different appearance and better file structure. Most commands have associated explanations and there is a referencing guide in the `content/1_introduction.tex` file.

I first made this template during the Summer of 2024 for my Capstone Project and have since been using a similar one for other reports.

Hope you enjoy it, and feel free to make changes as needed :)

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This template uses packages that require the **XeLaTeX compiler**.  
> If you are using **Overleaf**, simply **switch to that option in the settings**.  
> However, if running this project locally, some more packages and setup might be necessary.

Although this template can be used locally by simply cloning the repository, I recommend using Overleaf for the Capstone Project.
<!--There are two ways to create an Overleaf project based on this template:-->

<!--
### Method 1 - Overleaf Gallery Template

I've published this exact template into the Overleaf Gallery, where users can locate it and use it directly.~

1. Open the template link for this project
2. Use template for new project
3. Continue the project from there ~~
-->

### Zip/Import

1. Download this repository as a .zip file.
2. In Overleaf, select `New Project` > `Upload Project` and import the .zip file.
3. Continue the project from there (you might want to change the title of the project).

## Features

This template was remade from scratch, but the overall structure was based on the one presented on the Capstone Project website. The main differences are:

- Folder structure: the files for the different sections are separated in the `content` folder and used by `main.tex`.
- Labelling: in large projects, correctly labelling the sections, figures, and references is very important. This template provides an approach to manage this.
- Appearance: the footers, headers, code blocks, and hyper-references have been slightly changed for a more modern look.
- Customization: most settings can be easily changed in the `main.tex` file, which contains descriptions of most of the commands.

A preview of this template can be seen **[here](example.pdf)**.
